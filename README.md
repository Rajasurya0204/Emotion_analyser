# Emotion_analyser

This project presents an automated speech-based recognition system to
detect and classify the speaker based on the various voice source
parameters associated with the voice of the speaker. The objective of this
project is to identify the emotion of the speaker involved in a particular
session through speech recognition.
# Abstract:
An emotion recognition system for assessing human emotional behavior
from communication by a speaker includes a processing system configured
to receive signals representative of the verbal and/or non-verbal
communication. The processing system derives signal features from the
received signals. The processing system is further configured to implement
at least one intermediate mapping between the signal features and one or
more elements of an emotional ontology in order to perform an emotion
recognition decision. The emotional ontology provides a gradient
representation of the human emotional behavior.
